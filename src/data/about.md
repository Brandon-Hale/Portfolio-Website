# About Me

I'm a Software Engineer specialising in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and legacy system modernisation. Based in Perth, Australia, I've delivered 5+ enterprise applications leveraging .NET, React, and Azure AI with measurable performance gains. I'm passionate about building scalable architecture, optimising databases, and creating CI/CD automation that drives real business value.

Currently working as a Full Stack Software Engineer at the Australian Institute of Management, where I've leveraged Azure AI Search and Azure Open AI to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent document processing. I've architected mission-critical applications achieving 99.9% uptime and reduced system latency by 40%.

I take pride in writing clean, reusable code that's easy to maintain and understand—always with a focus on performance, security, and user experience. I'm process-driven, adaptable, and love collaborating with teams to build systems that make a real difference.
